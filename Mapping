- Last full charge in micro amp hour

/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_full_design
- Design full charge in micro amp hour

/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_now
/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/current_avg
/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/current_now
/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/cycle_count

/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/uevent
- This file seems special because it updates everything I seem
- to need for this, just how to actually extract the data in C
- This could basically be the same as reading all the other files
- but with only reading one file

/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/voltage_min_design
/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/voltage_now
